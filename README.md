This is a capstone project for the Google Data Analytics Course on Coursera. In this self-guided and independent project, I analyzed [bike share usage data](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html "Bike Share Data") for the two most recent quarters available - Q4 of 2019 and Q1 of 2020. I then analyzed differences in trends of bike share usage for customers (non-subscription based users) and subscribers, created visualizations to highlight the contrast between the two, and provided high-level reommendations and insights to the marketing and social media teams involved in the project. The company at stake is Cyclistic, a fictional company that provides bike share services to people.

This repository contains all materials used in this project. Included here you will find a presentation deliverable containing data documnentation, a summary of the analysis of the data, several visualizations, and a few recommendations for Cyclistic's marketing and oscial media teams.

Other deliverables include a Jupyter Notebook detailing the cleaning and condensing of files initially too large to upload to Google Sheets (in Python), a PDF containing full data documentation of the cleaning and manipulation of the datasets, and all the final data tables in CSV form used for analysis.
